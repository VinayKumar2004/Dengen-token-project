# Degen Token project(ERC-20): Unlocking the Future of Gaming

## Project Overview
Degen Token is an ERC-20 token designed to power the reward system for Degen Gaming, a game studio aiming to take gaming to the next level. The token allows players to earn rewards, transfer tokens to others, redeem tokens for in-game items, and burn tokens when they are no longer needed. The token contract is deployed on the Avalanche network, providing fast and low-fee transactions for an enhanced gaming experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
##### Connecting MetaMask to the Avalanche Test Network

Install the MetaMask browser extension if you haven't already: https://metamask.io.

Click on the MetaMask extension icon in your browser toolbar to open the MetaMask popup.

If you already have a MetaMask account, click on your account name and select "Import Account" to import your Avalanche testnet account using the mnemonic phrase.

If you don't have a MetaMask account, click on "Create a Wallet" and follow the instructions to create a new account using your Avalanche testnet mnemonic phrase.

Once you are logged in to MetaMask, click on the network dropdown (mainnet by default).

Select "Custom RPC" and enter the Avalanche Fuji Testnet RPC URL:

Network Name: Avalanche Fuji Testnet

New RPC URL: https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc

Chain ID: 43113

Symbol: AVAX

Block Explorer URL: https://cchain.explorer.avax-test.network/

Now, you should be connected to the Avalanche test network in MetaMask.
